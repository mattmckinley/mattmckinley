### Hey 👋

I’m Matt, an aspiring Front End Deveolper, Designer and Illustrator. My background in graphic design has given me the right disciplines to be self-directed, creative and detailed in my work. My observation and listening skills gained from various other front-facing roles make me a great part of any team. I am driven to succeed in this field and expand on knowledge and experience I have gained so far. 👍

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, furthering my CSS skills and exploring P5.js.
